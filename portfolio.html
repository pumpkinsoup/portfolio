    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a writer. I mostly write fiction and essays. My first novel, <em>In My Mother's House</em>, was published in 2012. It won awards. You might want to get your own copy. Let me know. Or you can request your local library to get a copy. That's fine too. I should be working on the second one but a part of me is still recovering from the first. While I pre-write, I do a variety of other things like relearning Mandarin and Spanish, as well as learning how to code. Eventually, I would not only write stories, but codes too. That's the goal. At least one of them.</p>
    <p>There must be a reason programming languages are called "languages," with their own syntax and grammar. That is my approach to learning coding. It will require a combination of knowing the rules and getting used to using them, and both of which would require a lot of exposure and practice. And yes, there is something about the solitude of writing codes that parallels that of writing stories. I think this is one of the reasons I feel like I can actually learn this. It's going to take a while but it's doable. In contrast, there are plenty of things that I just know I will never be able to learn no matter how hard I try.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Manila, Philippines and moved to NYC at the very tail-end of 2013. I'm still getting used to the cold. I'm not sure how many winters it would take for that to happen. In the meantime, I have amassed a lot of coats. But everyday I wake up and wonder when spring would come. Didn't the hedgehog say it'll be spring soon? Why would he say that if it wasn't true? And why is everything so expensive?</p>  </section>
